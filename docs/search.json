I hold a Master’s degree in Biology and have hands-on experience in both field and laboratory settings, including species identification, water quality assessment, habitat surveys, and ecological monitoring.\nMy research background spans fish and salamander population studies, snake behavioral ecology, and freshwater quality analysis. These projects have strengthened my ability to design and carry out environmental assessments and translate data into meaningful insights for conservation and policy.\nBeyond research, I enjoy communicating science to a wide range of audiences and have experience presenting findings to students and community groups. I am seeking opportunities in environmental consulting, ecological research, and conservation initiatives where I can apply my skills to protecting biodiversity in collaborative, community-focused settings.\n\nYou can explore my academic background, professional experience, and fieldwork skills using the navigation above. A selection of my wildlife photography is also available."

Phytoneuron (2022).\nThis study evaluated the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of Liberty Park Reservoir to assess ecological condition and establish baseline data for long-term monitoring. Water column analyses included light extinction, turbidity, nutrients, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen, and biochemical oxygen demand, while benthic assessments quantified periphyton biomass, sediment organic content, and algal community composition. Results indicated that the reservoir is ecologically impaired by nutrient enrichment and erosion, leading to eutrophic conditions and degraded phytoplankton and periphyton communities.\nSkills demonstrated: freshwater ecosystem assessment · water quality monitoring · nutrient and chlorophyll analysis · benthic periphyton sampling · algal and diatom identification · trophic state assessment · field instrumentation · ecological data interpretation · peer-reviewed scientific writing"
