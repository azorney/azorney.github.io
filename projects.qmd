## Publications

***Physical and algal characteristics of Liberty Park Reservoir in Clarksville, Tennessee***

Lebkuecher, J., Culley, A., Georgic, B., Hohman, E., Latta, H., Salman, N., Sennuga, T., Spruill, D., ***Zorney, A.***, & Atma, J. *Phytoneuron* (2022).  


This study evaluated the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of Liberty Park Reservoir to assess ecological condition and establish baseline data for long-term monitoring. Water column analyses included light extinction, turbidity, nutrients, chlorophyll *a*, dissolved oxygen, and biochemical oxygen demand, while benthic assessments quantified periphyton biomass, sediment organic content, and algal community composition. Results indicated that the reservoir is ecologically impaired by nutrient enrichment and erosion, leading to eutrophic conditions and degraded phytoplankton and periphyton communities.

**Skills demonstrated:** freshwater ecosystem assessment · water quality monitoring · nutrient and chlorophyll analysis · benthic periphyton sampling · algal and diatom identification · trophic state assessment · field instrumentation · ecological data interpretation · peer-reviewed scientific writing
